It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week as though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations for they were neither fair nor true How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges The bridge was fewer than ten years old and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well publicized murders Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers Herbert Chorley had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family A grim mood has gripped the country the opponent had concluded barely concealing his own broad grin And unfortunately this was perfectly true The Prime Minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual Even the weather was dismal all this chilly mist in the middle of July It wasn’t right it wasn’t normal He turned over the second page of the memo saw how much longer it went on and gave it up as a bad job Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully It was a handsome room with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows firmly closed against the unseasonable chill With a slight shiver the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass It was then as he stood with his back to the room that he heard a soft cough behind him He froze nose to nose with his own scared looking reflection in the dark glass He knew that cough He had heard it before He turned very slowly to face the empty room Hello he said trying to sound braver than he felt For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him However a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement It was coming as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room To the Prime Minister of Muggles Urgent we meet Kindly respond immediately Sincerely Fudge The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister Er said the Prime Minister listen It’s not a very good time for me I’m waiting for a telephone call you see from the President of That can be rearranged said the portrait at once The Prime Minister’s heart sank He had been afraid of that But I really was rather hoping to speak We shall arrange for the President to forget to call He will telephone tomorrow night instead said the little man Kindly respond immediately to Mr Fudge I oh very well said the Prime Minister weakly Yes I’ll see Fudge He hurried back to his desk straightening his tie as he went He had barely resumed his seat and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece He watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm as a portly man appeared within the flames spinning as fast as a top Seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin striped cloak a lime green bowler hat in his hand Ah Prime Minister said Cornelius Fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched Good to see you again The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge whose occasional appearances apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news Furthermore Fudge was looking distinctly careworn He was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before and it never boded well How can I help you he said shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk Difficult to know where to begin muttered Fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees What a week what a week Had a bad one too have you asked the Prime Minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge Yes of course said Fudge rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister I’ve been having the same week you have Prime Minister The Brockdale Bridge the Bones and Vance murders not to mention the ruckus in the West Country You er your I mean to say some of your people were were involved in those those things were they Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look Of course they were he said Surely you’ve realized what’s going on I hesitated the Prime Minister It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge’s visits so much He was after all the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy But of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day He had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself Naturally he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand He had remained speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non magical population from getting wind of them It was said Fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way Not to worry he had said it’s odds on you’ll never see me again I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our end something that’s likely to affect the Muggles
