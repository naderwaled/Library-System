The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it the Riddle House even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there It stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face Once a fne looking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the Riddle House was now damp derelict and unoccupied Te Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was creepy Half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce Te story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore Every version of the tale however started in the same place Fifty years before at daybreak on a fne summer’s morning when the  Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to fnd all three Riddles dead Te maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could Lying there with their eyes wide open Cold as ice Still in their dinner things Te police were summoned and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill disguised excitement Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles for they had been most unpopular Elderly Mr and Mrs Riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grown up son Tom had been if anything worse All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night Te Hanged Man the village pub did a roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders Tey were rewarded for leaving their fresides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested Frank cried several people Never Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener He lived alone in a run down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House Frank had come back from the war with a very sti? leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the Riddles ever since Tere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details Always thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry Unfriendly like I’m sure if I’ve o?ered him a cuppa once I’ve o?ered it a hundred times Never wanted to mix he didn’t Ah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war Frank He likes the quiet life Tat’s no reason to Who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook Tere’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember Nobody forced the door last night No broken windows All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping Te villagers exchanged dark looks I always thought he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the bar War turned him funny if you ask me said the landlord Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank didn’t I Dot said an excited woman in the corner Horrible temper said Dot nodding fervently I remember when he was a kid By the following morning hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton in the dark and dingy police station Frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger dark haired and pale Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him Ten just when things were looking very serious for Frank the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything
