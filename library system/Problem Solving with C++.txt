In this chapter we describe the basic components of a computer as well as the basic technique for designing and writing a program We then show you a sample C++ program and describe how it works A set of instructions for a computer to follow is called a program The collection of programs used by a computer is referred to as the software for that computer The actual physical machines that make up a computer installation are referred to as hardware As we will see the hardware for a computer is conceptually very simple However computers now come with a large array of software to aid in the task of programming This software includes editors translators and managers of various sorts The resulting environment is a complicated and powerful system In this book we are concerned almost exclusively with software but a brief overview of how the hardware is organized will be useful Hardware There are three main classes of computers PCs workstations and mainframes A PC personal computer is a relatively small computer designed to be used by one person at a time Most home computers are PCs but PCs are also widely used in business industry and science A workstation is essentially a larger and more powerful PC You can think of it as an industrial strength PC A mainframe is an even larger computer that typically requires some support staff and generally is shared by more than one user The distinctions between PCs workstations and mainframes are not precise but the terms are commonly used and do convey some very general information about a computer A network consists of a number of computers connected so that they may share resources such as printers and may share information A network might contain a number of workstations and one or more mainframes as well as shared devices such as printers For our purposes in learning programming it will not matter whether you are working on a PC a mainframe or a workstation The basic configuration of the computer as we will view it is the same for all three types of computers The hardware for most computer systems is organized as shown in The computer can be thought of as having five main components the input device the output device the processor also called the CPU for central processing unit the main memory and the secondary memory The processor main memory and secondary memory are normally housed in a single cabinet The processor and main memory form the heart of a computer and can be thought of as an integrated unit Other components connect to the main memory and operate under the direction of the processor The arrows in Display indicate the direction of information flow An input device is any device that allows a person to communicate information to the computer Your primary input devices are likely to be a keyboard and a mouse An output device is anything that allows the computer to communicate information to you The most common output device is a display screen referred to as a monitor Quite often there is more than one output device For example in addition to the monitor your computer probably is connected to a printer for producing output on paper The keyboard and monitor are sometimes thought of as a single unit called a terminal In order to store input and to have the equivalent of scratch paper for performing calculations computers are provided with memory The program that the computer executes is also stored in this memory A computer has two forms of memory called main memory and secondary memory The program that is being executed is kept in main memory and main memory is as the name implies the most important memory Main memory consists of a long list of numbered locations called memory locations the number of memory locations varies from one computer to another ranging from a few thousand to many millions and sometimes even into the billions each memory location contains a string of 0s and 1s The contents of these locations can change Hence you can think of each memory location as a tiny blackboard on which the computer can write and erase In most computers all memory locations contain the same number of zero one digits A digit that can assume only the values 0 or 1 is called a binary digit or a bit The memory locations in most computers contain eight bits or some multiple of eight bits An eight bit portion of memory is called a byte so we can refer to these numbered memory locations as bytes To rephrase the situation you can think of the computer’s main memory as a long list of numbered memory locations called bytes The number that identifies a byte is called its address A data item such as a number or a letter can be stored in one of these bytes and the address of the byte is then used to find the data item when it is needed If the computer needs to deal with a data item such as a large number that is too large to fit in a single byte it will use several adjacent bytes to hold the data item In this case the entire chunk of memory that holds the data item is still called a memory location The address of the first of the bytes that make up this memory location is used as the address for this larger memory location Thus as a practical matter you can think of the computer’s main memory as a long list of memory locations of varying sizes The size of each of these locations is expressed in bytes and the address of the first byte is used as the address name of that memory location a picture of a hypothetical computer’s main memory The sizes of the memory locations are not fixed but can change when a new program is run on the computer or in most other programming languages There is however one point about this use of 0s and 1s that will concern us as soon as we start to write programs The computer needs to interpret these strings of 0s and 1s as numbers letters instructions or other types of information The computer performs these interpretations automatically according to certain coding schemes A different code is used for each different type of item that is stored in the computer’s memory one code for letters another for whole numbers another for fractions another for instructions and so on For example in one commonly used set of codes is the code for the letter A and also for the number 65 In order to know what the string in a particular location stands for the computer must keep track of which code is currently being used for that location Fortunately the programmer seldom needs to be concerned with such codes and can safely reason as though the locations actually contained letters numbers or whatever is desired
